# azurerm-mcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that indexes, analyzes, and serves the terraform provider azurerm go source code on demand to MCP compatible AI agents.

## Features

**Provider Discovery**

List and search all AzureRM resources and data sources with fast, FTS-backed lookups

**Schema Inspection**

Deep schema analysis showing attributes, types, validations, ForceNew flags, conflicts, and nested blocks

**Code Search**

Search across all provider Go files for patterns, functions, or free text

**Resource Comparison**

Compare two resources side-by-side to understand schema differences and similarities

**Update Behavior Analysis**

Determine whether changing a specific attribute requires resource recreation or supports in-place updates

**Breaking Change Explanations**

Understand why attributes are marked ForceNew and get migration strategies

**Similar Resource Discovery**

Find resources with similar schemas using ML-based Jaccard similarity scoring

**Validation Analysis**

Detect missing or weak validations in resource schemas and get improvement suggestions

**Dependency Tracing**

Visualize attribute dependencies including ConflictsWith, ExactlyOneOf, AtLeastOneOf, and RequiredWith

**Source Code Access**

Retrieve Go source snippets including schema definitions, CustomizeDiff logic, timeouts, and importers

**Documentation Access**

Fetch official provider documentation for any resource or data source

**Test Discovery**

List acceptance tests that cover specific resources

**GitHub Sync**

Syncs and indexes the provider from GitHub into a local SQLite database for fast queries.

Supports incremental updates and extracts schema metadata from Go AST parsing.

## Prerequisites

Go 1.23.0 or later

SQLite (with FTS5 support - included in most modern installations)

GitHub Personal Access Token (optional, for higher rate limits) with `repo → public_repo` rights.

## Configuration

**Server flags**

The server accepts command-line flags for configuration:

--org - GitHub organization name (default: "hashicorp")

--repo - Repository name (default: "terraform-provider-azurerm")

--token - GitHub personal access token (optional; improves rate limits)

--db - Path to SQLite database file (default: "azurerm-provider.db")

**Adding to AI agents**

To use this MCP server with AI agents (Claude CLI, Copilot, Codex CLI, or other MCP-compatible clients), add it to their configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "az-cn-azurerm": {
      "command": "/path/to/az-cn-azurerm-mcp",
      "args": ["--org", "hashicorp", "--repo", "terraform-provider-azurerm", "--token", "YOUR_TOKEN"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Build from source

make build

## Example Prompts

**Once configured, you can ask any agentic agent that supports additional MCP servers:**

**Cross-Reference with WAM MCP**

Are there any missing key things or features if you compare the wam module agw mcp with the terraform providider mcp resource azurerm_application_gateway regarding the module examples?

What does the CloudNation vnet module expose that azurerm_virtual_network doesn't enforce through validation?

Compare the kv module examples from WAM with azurerm_key_vault schema ,are there any attributes the module uses that have weak validations in the provider?

Looking at the redis module in WAM, does it use any azurerm_redis_cache attributes that are marked ForceNew, and would those prevent in-place updates?

What required attributes does azurerm_storage_account have that the CloudNation storage module doesn't expose as variables?

Does the WAM pe module handle all the ConflictsWith constraints that exist in azurerm_private_endpoint?

Check if the CloudNation aks module examples use any azurerm_kubernetes_cluster attributes that would trigger recreation on change.

What validation patterns does the agw module implement that should also exist in the azurerm_application_gateway schema?

Are there sensitive attributes in azurerm_container_registry that the acr module exposes without marking them sensitive?

Compare the default values in the CloudNation func module with the azurerm_function_app schema defaults.

**Sync and Maintenance**

Run a full sync of the provider and report the job ID; then show the sync status for that job ID.

Run an incremental sync (updates only) and report the job ID; then show the sync status for that job ID.

What's the current provider sync status?

**Tips**
```
For schema inspection, use compact: true to get bullet lists instead of full tables.

Use flags like ["force_new"] or ["required", "sensitive"] to filter attributes.

For similar resource discovery, adjust similarity_threshold (0.0-1.0) to be more or less strict.

Resource comparisons work best when comparing resources in the same service area.

Breaking change explanations include both technical reasons and Azure API limitations.
```

## Notes

GitHub token is optional; without it, syncing still works but may hit lower API rate limits. Pass `--token` to raise limits.

Initial full sync takes ~20 seconds and indexes 9,000+ Go files. Subsequent incremental syncs are much faster.

Deleting the database file will cause a full rebuild the next time the server is called.

The parser extracts schema metadata using Go AST analysis for accuracy.

## Direct Database Access

The indexed data is stored in a SQLite database file with FTS5 enabled. You can query it directly for ad‑hoc inspection:

`sqlite3 azurerm-provider.db "SELECT name, kind FROM provider_resources LIMIT 10"`

`sqlite3 azurerm-provider.db "SELECT name FROM provider_resources WHERE name LIKE '%network%' AND kind = 'resource'"`

`sqlite3 azurerm-provider.db "
  SELECT r.name, COUNT(a.id) as force_new_count
  FROM provider_resources r
  JOIN provider_resource_attributes a ON r.id = a.resource_id
  WHERE a.force_new = 1 AND r.kind = 'resource'
  GROUP BY r.id
  ORDER BY force_new_count DESC
  LIMIT 10"
`

`sqlite3 azurerm-provider.db "
  SELECT r.name, a.name as attribute
  FROM provider_resources r
  JOIN provider_resource_attributes a ON r.id = a.resource_id
  WHERE a.sensitive = 1
  ORDER BY r.name"
`
